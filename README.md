# Keck HIRES PRV Pipeline Service Access

This repository contains all the software necessary to run the HIRES PRV pipeline remotely from Python
and reduce astronomical radial velocity measurements from that instrument.

The "hiresprv" directory contains the software itself, though most users will normally install it using
PyPI ("pip install hiresprv").

The "doc" directory contains documentation, including the library documents generated from in-line
Python docstrings, as a Sphinx document set.

The "Jupyter" directory contains a Jupyter page that illustrated the end-to-end process of using the
Python tools for reduction.  This page has not been tested and inferring anything from it is done
at your own risk.

For a rendering of the Sphinx documentation, see: https://caltech-ipac.github.io/hiresprv/hiresprv.html
