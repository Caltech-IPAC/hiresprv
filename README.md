# hiresprv
Keck HIRES PRV pipeline service access

This repository will eventually contain the Python library astronomers will use to interact with the Keck HIRES PRV pipeline web services.  To start with we will use it as a place to host priliminary documentation.  The code in the hiresprv directory is a set of stubs for that purpose and will be replaced shortly.
