; NAME:
;	PS_OPEN
;
; PURPOSE:
;	This procedure switches the current output device to PostScript.
;
; CATEGORY:
;	Device management.
;
; CALLING SEQUENCE:
;	PS_OPEN [,FName]
;
; OPTIONAL INPUTS:
;	FName:	File name of output PostScript file.  Either '.ps' or '.eps'
;		will automatically be appended.  If not present 'idl.ps' or
;		'idl.eps' is used.
;
; KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
;	/HELP:		Use this switch so see the USAGE line with all the
;			possible parameters and keywords.
;			
;	/PORTRAIT:	Forces portrait orientation.  Landscape is the
;			default.
;
;	/COLOR:		Set this switch if you want to use ANY other color
;			table besides the default black to white (low to
;			high values).  The current color table will be
;			copied to the PostScript device.  The color table
;			will be interpolated to fill the color table of
;			the PostScript device (typically 256).  The system
;			variables !P.Color and !P.Background are set to the
;			darkest and lightest colors in the table,
;			respectively.  Reset these, if desired.  Other color
;			tables can be loaded after calling PS_OPEN.  If you
;			load another color table, be sure to reset the
;			!P.Color system variable to color table entry to
;			to use in PLOT annotations.
;
;	THICK=		Set this keyword to the value by which all line
;			thicknesses system variables will be multiplied.
;			For full page camera ready figures a value of
;			THICK=4 or 5 is reasonable.
;			THICK increase will not override any explicit line
;			thickness definitions like "PLOT, [0,1], THICK=2".
;			To use the THICK keyword effectively code,
;			"PLOT, [0,1], THICK=2*!P.THICK", instead.
;
;	/PS_FONTS:	Set this switch if you want to use the PostScript
;			hardware fonts in plot annotations.  This is identical
;			to entering "!P.FONTS=0".  It's just a little easier.
;			ISOLatin1 versions of the PostScript fonts are used.
;
;	/ENCAPSULATED:	Set this switch is you want to generate an Encapsulated
;			PostScript file.  The file extension will be '.eps'
;			rather than the default '.ps'.  Since this plot is
;			assumed to become part of another document, no rotation
;			of the figure will occur even in the default landscape
;			mode.  Portrait and landscape aspect rations will be
;			maintained.
;
;	/ADOBESTANDARD	Set this switch to use the standard Adobe fonts.
;			By default, PS_OPEN uses ISOLatin1 Adobe fonts which
;			are similar to the ISOLatin1 Hershey font !3 (Simplex
;			Roman).  For example, the ISOLatin1 encoding for
;			the Angstrom symbol is STRING(197B), and plus-or-
;			minus is STRING(177B).  See any ISOLatin1 chart for
;			other symbols.
;
; COMMON BLOCKS:
;	fen_ps_common:	The common block hold the PostScript file name and
;			variables for the original device.  It is shared with
;			PS_CLOSE so that the environment of the original
;			device and its variables can be restored and the
;			output file closed.
;
; SIDE EFFECTS:
;	The plotting device is changed to PostScript until PS_CLOSE is
;	called.
;
;	Various system variables are changed in the PostScript environment,
;	but all the ones from the previous plotting environment are saved and
;	will be restored by PS_CLOSE.
;
;	A 1 inch border is set in both landscape and portrait orientations.
;
;	The BITS_PER_PIXEL is set to 8 to give the maximum number of colors
;	(and thus the largest possible file size).  This is only of importance
;	if you're using a color table.
;
;	Since PostScript plots black ink on white paper, the system variables
;	!P.BACKGROUND and !P.FOREGROUND are set to the lightest and darkest
;	entries in the current color table if /COLOR is set.  Otherwise the
;	lightest and darkest entries are obtained from the default color
;	table.  Changing !P.BACKGROUND does NOT change the actual PostScript
;	background.  This is a bug/feature of IDL.  But, the variable is set
;	so that any routines that wish to plot in the background (white)
;	color can do so by accessing this system variable.
;
; RESTRICTIONS:
;	PS_OPEN and PS_CLOSE are complimentary functions.  Always use PS_CLOSE
;	to end a PS_OPEN session regardless of whether you want or don't want
;	the output.  PS_CLOSE does not automatically send output to the printer,
;	so you don't have to worry about that happening.
;
; PROCEDURE:
;	Straight forward.  :-)
;
; EXAMPLE:
;	PS_OPEN, 'empty', /PS_Fonts, /Port, Thick=5
;	PLOT, [0,1], /NoData, XTitle='!15Day Number', YTitle='Hour Angle'
;	PLOT, day, test1	 		;normal thickness (5)
;	PLOT, day, test2, Thick=0.5*!P.Thick	;half as thick (2.5)
;	PS_CLOSE
;
;	LOADCT, 5
;	PS_OPEN, 'im22', /Port, /Color
;	image(Where(image EQ 0)) = !P.Background    ;map low values to white
;	TV, image
;	PS_CLOSE
;
; MODIFICATION HISTORY:
; 	Written by:	Fen Tamanaha, 07/09/93 Release 2.1.
;	940804 Fen - ISOLatin1 encoding made the default, and the
;			/AdobeStandard keyword added.
;	940805 Fen - Cleaned up handling of color tables.
;	950125 Fen - Fixed /Portrait keyword.
